# CameraXProject

A simple example of using Jetpack CameraX to record video with [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).


### Technologies
- **UI** - [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) ([Material3](https://m3.material.io/))
- **Camera Api** - [Jetpack CameraX](https://developer.android.com/training/camerax)
- **Video player library** - [Exoplayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer)

> CameraX and Exopler do not support Jetpack Compose, so in this project you can also see how to get around that.
